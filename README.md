emacs-config
============

My emacs config.  However, it should be general enough for others to use.  A
large portion of the code and ideas was stolen from
https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/, with a bunch of other sources mixed in
throughout.

The basic layout is a main init.el file, along with a bunch of other
configuration files in the config/ directory.
